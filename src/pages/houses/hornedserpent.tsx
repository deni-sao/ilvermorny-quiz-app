              Here are the big takeaways from the creature itself: It resembles
              a snake and, much like Harry Potter with the python at the zoo or
              the basilisk at the school, our newest hero, Isolt Sayre, can
              speak to it, meaning that Parselmouths definitely exist in
              America, too. It is why she felt a kinship with the snake, and the
              reason it was chosen as the head of the house. The serpent has a
              jewel in the middle of its forehead, and the gem was what drew
              Sayre to the snake in the first place.

              Students sorted into Horned Serpent are highly intelligent and
              scholarly, but also resourceful and look out for one another. It
              is very close to how the students of Hogwarts operated, but
              without that whole "I have got to look like I am the best in front
              of Lord Voldemort" pressure.
