              The Pukwudgie is a short gray animal with comically large ears
              that is native to America. It is best known for being fiercely
              independent, mischievous and not overly friendly to nonmagical
              creatures. The beast, which is a distant relative of the European
              goblin - which, some might remember, ran Gringotts in Diagon Alley
              - uses poisonous arrows to hunt.

            </h3>
            <p className="mb-5 text-lg font-medium leading-7 text-coolGray-500">
              The Pukwudgie house was named by James Steward, one of the last
              founding members to join the pack, and was only crowned as the
              official symbol of the house because Steward realized the rest of
              the founders were using magical creatures, and he thought the
              Pukwudgie was hilarious.

            <p className="text-lg font-medium leading-7 text-coolGray-500">
              Those who are sorted into Pukwudgie have the same traits as the
              creature that represents their house: They are wickedly smart and
              independent. The closest analog at Hogwarts would probably be
              Ravenclaw. Pukwudgie House is sometimes considered to represent
              the heart of a witch or wizard. It is also said that Pukwudgie
              favours healers.
